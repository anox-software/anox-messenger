## GIT-001 — Git / GitHub Baseline

**Objective:** Put the CURRENT verified anoX Messenger project under clean Git version control and connect it to the private GitHub repository.

**Result:** PASS

- Local Git baseline created.
- `main` and `v1-foundation-baseline` tag pushed to `anox-admin/ax-messenger`.
- Repository visibility verified as PRIVATE.
- CI workflow created and executed.
- Rust tests pass in CI.

## TOOLCHAIN-001 — Android Toolchain Alignment

**Objective:** Repair the inconsistent Android build-toolchain baseline and restore green Android CI using the smallest, lowest-risk toolchain change.

**Result:** PASS

- Created branch `toolchain-001/android-toolchain-alignment`.
- Verified actual checked-in source of truth: `AGP 8.13.2`, `KGP 1.9.20`, `Gradle 9.3.1`.
- Determined historical `AGP 9.1.1` / `Kotlin 2.2.10` was a documentation error.
- Upgraded `KGP` to `2.4.10` and added `org.jetbrains.kotlin.plugin.compose` `2.4.10`.
- Preserved AGP, Gradle, `compileSdk`, `targetSdk`, `minSdk`, and NDK.
- Rust tests: 15/15 PASS locally.
- GitHub Actions CI run `32342258423`: Rust, Android debug build, and Android release compile smoke all PASS.
- Connected Android instrumentation not run in CI (no emulator); historical 35/35 remains accepted.
- No application functionality, cryptography, or security invariants changed.

**No Device Authentication work was started.**
